Discover more about Chick-fil-A’s waffle fries recipe here as we dive into the fry frenzy taking the internet by storm!

Chick-fil-A’s latest recipe update has left fans in a salty state. What happens when you tweak something beloved? You get social media in full fry rebellion mode! In November 2024, the brand added pea starch to its famous Waffle Potato Fries, promising crispier fries. But for many fans, the only thing crunchier is their disappointment.

## The Recipe Change Explained

The plot thickens—or rather, the coating does. Chick-fil-A’s new recipe introduces pea starch to keep the fries crispier for longer. According to Chick-fil-A:

> “We recently made a slight adjustment to our Waffle Potato Fries recipe, which offers the same great taste while also making our Waffle Potato Fries stay crispier, longer.”

The company assures customers the new fries don’t include any of the nine major allergens, but pea starch has still made some parents—and fries—crumble.

## Customer Reactions: From Soggy Smiles to Fry Frowns

Social media has become a hot potato of opinions. Here’s a taste of the drama:

- *"The new waffle fries are horrible… like eating fried cardboard!”* one unhappy Redditor wrote.
- Another lamented, *"CFA, why fix something that wasn’t broken? These new fries are as dry as my Monday mornings."*
- Even superfan Daryl-Ann Denner was caught off guard. First, she blamed a bad batch. Then, she suspected a rogue Chick-fil-A location. But soon, the truth was as clear as ketchup:

> "They’re grainy, dry, and totally lacking flavor! My kids won’t touch them."

## Allergies: The Pea Starch Pickle

Pea starch isn’t one of the top nine allergens, but legume-sensitive diners aren’t thrilled. Some parents are up in arms:

> *"We loved Chick-fil-A. Now we’re out because my child has a pea allergy,"* one worried mom wrote.

Even though the risk of a reaction is low, the change has left fry-loving families feeling betrayed.

## Fans Demand the Return of OG Fries

Petitions, tweets, and Instagram comments are piling up faster than fries in a combo meal:

- *"Give us back the original fries! Please, Chick-fil-A! We beg!"*
- *"I used to dream about those fries. Now I wake up in a crispy nightmare."*
